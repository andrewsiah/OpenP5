Goal: I want to test how data mixture affects the performance of the model on all the downstream tasks in the evals.

I need a mixture of data and evals.

e.g. for Beauty, CDs, Clothing, Electronics and Movies dataset. 
For the current setup of running on sequential data.


1. I want to run eval on all 5 data mixtures at every epoch.
2. I want to pre-make the data mixtures for all 5 datasets. The mixture is a constant amount of data that have different weights for each dataset. The weights are a dirichlet distribution.



Based on the code and your goal from ANDREW.md to "test how data mixture affects the performance of the model on all the downstream tasks in the evals", here are some key things to consider:

1. Data Mixture Creation:
- You'll need to implement a way to create data mixtures with different weights following a Dirichlet distribution
- This should be done for all 5 datasets (Beauty, CDs, Clothing, Electronics and Movies)
- The total amount of data should remain constant across different mixtures

2. Evaluation Pipeline:
- The current code has evaluation capabilities through SingleRunner and DistributedRunner
- You'll need to modify the training/evaluation loop to:
  - Run evaluations on all 5 datasets at every epoch
  - Track performance metrics across different data mixtures

3. Configuration:
- Add new command line arguments or config options for:
  - Dirichlet distribution parameters
  - Data mixture ratios
  - Total data amount to use
  - Which datasets to include in mixtures

4. Logging:
- Set up logging to track:
  - Data mixture ratios used
  - Performance metrics for each dataset
  - Cross-dataset performance comparisons

5. Analysis Tools:
- Create scripts to:
  - Visualize how different mixture ratios affect performance
  - Compare performance across datasets
  - Analyze any transfer effects between datasets

Key Implementation Steps:
1. Create a data mixture generator class/function
2. Modify the data loading pipeline to handle mixtures
3. Extend the evaluation pipeline to test on all datasets
4. Add configuration options for mixture experiments
5. Set up comprehensive logging
6. Create analysis tools

Would you like me to help you implement any of these specific components?
